AI was used to bootstrap the package structure, and in particular it was used to
author all of the unit tests with very minor human intervention. It did go nuts
a time or two and I had to step in, but for the most part it did fine with
writing the test cases.

AI tab completion totally wrote the word façade for me a lot too.
